## MICCAI23

MHub is part of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) and will be showcased at the MICCAI23 NCI Imaging Data Commons tutorial. You can find the notebook we 
developed for MICCAI23 under `notebooks/MICCAI23_tutorial.ipynb`. We are also planning to share the slide deck used in the first part of the tutorial here.
