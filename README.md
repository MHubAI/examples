# MHubAI Usage Examples

This repository stores example usages of MHub models, such as scripts and notebooks.

## NA-MIC 41th Project Week

A newer version of the MHub Universal Notebook will be presented at the 41st Project Week 2024 in Boston.
The notebook allows MHub models to be run in a free environment on public sample data downloaded directly from IDC and includes an interactive visualization of segmentation results and is available under [notebooks/PW41_tutorial.ipynb](notebooks/PW41_tutorial.ipynb).

## MICCAI23

MHub is part of the Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC) and was showcased at the MICCAI23 NCI Imaging Data Commons tutorial. You can find the notebook we developed for MICCAI23 under [notebooks/MICCAI23_tutorial.ipynb](notebooks/MICCAI23_tutorial.ipynb). You can also find the slides we presented in the first part of the tutorial
